Which statement best describes the primary pathophysiologic mechanism of perinatal biliary atresia?,Failure of ductal plate remodeling during embryogenesis,Autoimmune-mediated bile duct epithelial injury after birth,Recanalization defect of the biliary tree during fetal development,Vascular insult to the hepatic artery leading to ductal ischemia,Toxic accumulation of bile salts secondary to hepatocellular dysfunction,B,"Perinatal biliary atresia arises from postnatal bile duct epithelial injury, likely triggered by immune and infectious mechanisms in genetically predisposed infants. This contrasts with syndromic (embryonic) forms caused by early developmental defects. Animal and human studies support a model involving viral injury, immune activation, and fibro-obliteration of the ducts.","Lakshminarayanan B, Davenport M. Semin Pediatr Surg. 2017;26:91–98.",Biliary Atresia,Advanced
Which genetic abnormality is most strongly associated with the biliary atresia–splenic malformation (BASM) syndrome?,Jagged1 mutation,CFC1 mutation,ZIC3 mutation,PKHD1 mutation,CFTR mutation,B,"The CFC1 gene, involved in left–right axis determination, is the genetic defect most often associated with BASM syndrome. While it increases susceptibility to laterality defects and biliary malformation, it is not sufficient alone to cause BA. Other implicated genes include ZIC3 and GPC1.",Ware SM et al. Hum Genet. 2004;115:228–233.,Biliary Atresia,Advanced
Which viral infection has the strongest experimental evidence supporting a potential causative role in biliary atresia?,Cytomegalovirus (CMV),Reovirus type 3,Rotavirus,Epstein-Barr virus,Adenovirus,C,"Neonatal rotavirus infection in mice reproduces the histologic and clinical features of biliary atresia, including bile duct inflammation and fibrosis. This experimental model supports the hypothesis that postnatal viral infection can trigger immune-mediated cholangiopathy in susceptible hosts.",Shivakumar P et al. Gastroenterology. 2007;133:1568–1577.,Biliary Atresia,Advanced
Which anatomic type of biliary atresia involves obliteration of the bile ducts up to the porta hepatis?,Type I,Type IIa,Type IIb,Type III,Type IV,D,Type III biliary atresia (85–90% of cases) is characterized by obliteration of the biliary tract up to the porta hepatis. This extensive form necessitates a Kasai portoenterostomy for bile drainage.,Superina R et al. Ann Surg. 2011;254:577–585.,Biliary Atresia,Advanced
Which of the following findings on abdominal ultrasound is most specific for biliary atresia?,Intrahepatic ductal dilation,Triangular cord sign above the porta hepatis,Absent gallbladder,Enlarged echogenic liver,Dilated common bile duct,B,The triangular cord sign—an echogenic density anterior to the portal vein bifurcation—has high specificity for BA. Absence of a gallbladder is also suggestive but not pathognomonic.,Lee HJ et al. Radiology. 1997;204:355–358.,Biliary Atresia,Advanced
Which laboratory pattern is most characteristic of biliary atresia?,High total bilirubin with low γ-GTP,Isolated indirect hyperbilirubinemia,Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with markedly elevated γ-GTP,Elevated ALT with normal bilirubin,Low alkaline phosphatase and high AST,C,"Biliary atresia typically presents with conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia and a markedly elevated γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP), reflecting cholestatic injury. A normal γ-GTP essentially rules out BA.",Mack CL et al. Hepatology. 2017;65:204–216.,Biliary Atresia,Advanced
What is the gold standard diagnostic test for confirming biliary atresia?,Ultrasound showing absent gallbladder,HIDA scan with no excretion into bowel,Percutaneous liver biopsy,Operative cholangiogram demonstrating absence of ductal continuity,Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP),D,"Operative cholangiography is the gold standard for diagnosing biliary atresia, demonstrating lack of communication between intrahepatic ducts and the intestine. It remains indispensable despite advances in imaging.",Davenport M. Semin Pediatr Surg. 2017;26:91–98.,Biliary Atresia,Advanced
Which histopathologic feature is most consistent with biliary atresia?,Hepatocellular ballooning without fibrosis,Expanded portal tracts with bile duct proliferation and portal fibrosis,Macrovesicular steatosis,Kupffer cell hyperplasia with minimal inflammation,Bridging fibrosis with regenerative nodules,B,"Biliary atresia is characterized by expanded portal tracts, bile duct proliferation, portal fibrosis, and bile plugs. Severity of fibrosis correlates with native liver survival after Kasai.",Russo P et al. Am J Surg Pathol. 2014;38:190–201.,Biliary Atresia,Advanced
